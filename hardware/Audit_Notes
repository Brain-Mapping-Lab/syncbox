Audit Notes -- this was mainly brought up in regards to discontinued components in the BOM.

1. Confirm filter cut-offs and symmetry.
2. Why Tantanum where selected? Should be low load. Low F filtering?
3. Why 1.8 V bias? Would 3.3 V work?
4. Revisit C13/14 -- They do not match the desired load for the crystal oscillator.
		CL = 16pF
		C13 = C14 = 0.1uF
		CL << ((C13 * C14) / (C13  + C14)) + C_stray ~ 50nF -- This will cause the crystal to oscillate slowly.

5. See Op Amp analysis
6. Assess current connectors -- may be worth moving over to more standard ones.
